loc1event0 = '''Greetings adventurer. 
It's been a long time since I've seen someone as... 
solid (random adjective?) [solid, greasy, staunch, ready]
as you.   

Well. I presume you're looking for work.(quest?)
Adventurers usually are. Itinerant folk. 
Our town's got a tavern, a square, and some other places,
but those places would be good to start lookin for work.
Good luck to you, stranger.
